RRDWeather is a set of scripts working with RRDtool and weather.com.

It collects weather info from the web on a regular basis and puts it in RRDtool graphs.

To report problems, please now use the issue tracker under the Issues tab. This would make it easier to keep track of issues. Thanks.

I've created a Google Group for the project, if enough people join, I may use this for announcing new releases : http://groups.google.com/group/rrdweather
